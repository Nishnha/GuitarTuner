# GuitarTuner
A simple guitar tuner for my operating systems class written in Kotlin.

# Demo
[Watch my YouTube demo](https://youtu.be/XYrrDOhKg18) to see the tuner in action.
The app can be built for a specific device through Android Studio. The button placement is specific to the Google Pixel, however, and may not work as intented with other devices. No APK is included.

# How does it work?
The tuner is explained in detail [in the Guitar Tuner powerpoint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N7G4n2TAE23l6VhHOJKA-baDq7gA5vL3/view?usp=sharing). In essence, the phone is set to vibrate at the same frequency as that of the string!

# Does this really work?
No, not really. The phone vibration motor is too slow to vibrate at some of the higher tunings. The phone also doesn't remain in contact with the guitar well enough to accurately tune it. The principle behind the method is vaild though, and could work well with a more precise, attached motor.
